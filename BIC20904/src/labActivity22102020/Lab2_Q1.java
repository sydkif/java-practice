    Question 1
    
    Write a program that reads studentsâ€™ scores, gets the best 
    score, and then assigns grades based on the following 
    scheme:
    Grade is A if score is greater than or equal to best-5;
    Grade is B if score is greater than or equal to best-10;
    Grade is C if score is greater than or equal to best-15;
    Grade is D if score is greater than or equal to best-20;
    Grade is F otherwise.
    The program prompts the user to enter the total number 
    of students, and then prompts the user to enter all of the 
    scores, and concludes by displaying the grades.
